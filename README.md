# Text Editor with Font Selector

### Project Description

This project is a simple text editor that allows users to change the font family, font weight, and italic style of the text using Google Fonts. The font selector provides a list of all available Google Fonts, and the font weight selector shows the appropriate font weights supported for the selected font family. The italic toggle is active only if the selected font family and weight combination supports italic. The editor also includes an auto-save feature that saves the text and font settings locally in the browser. On reloading the page, the existing content and font settings are restored.
